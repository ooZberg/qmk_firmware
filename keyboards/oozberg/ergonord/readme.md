# Ergonord Keyboard

The Ergonord keyboard, as in ergonomic nordic, is 7Ã—4+6 keys column-staggered split keyboard, based on Sofle Choc. Unlike most other split keyboard, Ergonord adds a 7th row which makes it easier to map out a Nordic keyboard layout. The thumb cluster is also moved to allow more keys to be reachable by the thumb.
